# Boostgram 🚀

Boostgram is a frontend application written in TypeScript that provides a platform for users to simulate the experience of buying likes, comments, and followers for Instagram. It includes login and logout functionality, along with a mock authentication system. Note that this project focuses solely on the frontend, and the backend is non-functional, so certain features may not work as expected. This project was built purely to demonstrate and get myself learning the TypeScript language to improve my Tech Stack.

## Features ✨

- **Login/Logout Functionality**  
  Users can log in and log out using the provided mock credentials.

- **Buy Instagram Engagement**  
  Options to "purchase" likes, comments, and followers are presented in a sleek, responsive user interface.

- **Mock Authentication**  
  Use the credentials below to test the login feature:  
  - **Username**: `user:1`  
  - **Password**: `password:1`  

- **Frontend Only**  
  This project covers all the essentials of a modern frontend application but does not include a backend.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Framework**: React (written with TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap / React-Bootstrap
- **Build Tool**: Vite  

## Setup Instructions ⚙️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/conor-timmis/Boostgram.git
   cd Boostgram
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Limitations 🛑

- The backend is non-functional, so no actual data is saved or retrieved.
- Certain features, like purchasing or tracking Instagram engagement, are purely for demonstration purposes.

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Implement a fully functional backend for real data handling.
- Add a database for user authentication and engagement tracking.
- Enhance the UI/UX with more animations and dynamic interactions.
